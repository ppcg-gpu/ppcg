/* A WRITE LATER MEMBER MUST NOT KILL AN EARLIER MEMBER'S LIVENESS.
 *
 * Two arrays share storage by annotation. `a` writes its whole range;
 * later `b` -- a DIFFERENT array in the C -- writes over the same bytes.
 * Nobody inside the scop reads either write: both are live out, because
 * the caller can still reach each array's bytes through that array.
 *
 * If liveness is judged over the COMPOSED relations, `b`'s must-write
 * covers `a`'s may-write on the representative, compute_live_out
 * subtracts it away, and `a`'s loop is eliminated as dead -- while the
 * caller still sees `a` unwritten. Measured on the 402-node scop: 2115
 * arrays losing a write against 1951 without the annotation, and nine
 * of the eleven parameters losing writes were the representatives the
 * pragmas named first; the scheduler then died in "unable to carry
 * dependences" with zero bands. The nopragma control on the same file
 * scheduled 315 bands.
 *
 * Liveness must be judged over the arrays the source names. This file
 * is that rule in nine lines: with the fix, both loops are scheduled and
 * `a[c0]` is present in the output; without it, the first loop is gone
 * and ppcg reports "arrays losing a write: a".
 *
 * WHY THIS IS READ RATHER THAN RUN.  The two arrays are annotated at the
 * same offset, so they are the same bytes, and `b` writes them last.  A
 * reference built from this source and a candidate built from the
 * translation print the same thing whether or not the first loop
 * survived: the elimination is invisible in the values and shows up only
 * in what was translated.  Disjoint offsets do not rescue the
 * comparison either -- the defect needs `b`'s must-write to COVER `a`'s
 * may-write on the representative, and where the two do not overlap
 * there is no covering and nothing to reproduce.  Hence tests/liveness,
 * which reads the translation, rather than tests/deadcode, which runs
 * it.
 *
 * With the rule taken back out of the current tree -- ppcg.c asking pet
 * for the composed writes where it asks for the plain ones -- this file
 * gives, measured:
 *
 *     ppcg: eliminated dead instances: { S_0[i_0] : 0 <= i_0 <= 4095 }
 *     ppcg: arrays losing a write: a
 *
 * and no `a[c0]` anywhere in the output.
